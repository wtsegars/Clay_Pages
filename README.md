# Simple Blog

This is a template for a basic blog (or news website) that is written in PHP along with JavaScript, MySQL, and scant amounts of HTML and CSS. This project is designed to be a basic blog-style website that can be downloaded and be manipulated in nearly endless ways for different purposes. This site requires XAMPP and the use of Apache Web Server.
